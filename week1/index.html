		<h1> About Jessica </h1>
		<p>Hi. I have learned HTML before and somewhat some CSS. I currently work as a web designer at my job but I have little to no use of HTML in my job.
		I haven't practiced a lot of HTML since my first year of high school when I used to be obsessed with learning it on my own. 
		I have a portfolio website made from all of the websites I have produced though. It is at  <a href="http://hellojessi.com">hellojessi.com </a></p>
		<p>I think the reason why I struggled so much on figuring out where to start was because I couldn't see what this program was putting out. It turns out I forgot to
		change the end tag to be .html. oops. That and because I didn't know how to put in the CSS. I learned how to do some of the individual CSS but not the input of it into the HTML 
		until I learned it. It's a good thing that doesn't take a long time...		</p>
