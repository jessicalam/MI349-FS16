							<h2>Needs Are Met</h2>
						</a>
						<p class="date">Published: November 15, 2016</p>
						<p>In the short story, The Giving Tree, written by Shel Silverstein, there is a young boy that is loved by a tree. The story shows the different ways the tree impacted the boy’s life. The giving tree gives the boy love and the things he wanted in order for him to be happy and grow. My parents relate to the giving tree because they have given me a lot like a place to live, food and their love in order for me to grow. Back before America became America, Britain wanted people to colonize and inhabit America so they sent people there by offering money and land. Through Silverstein’s short story, The Giving Tree, my parents’ influence on my life and America’s beginnings with Britain, it shows that growth will occur when needs are met. 
						</p>
						<p>In the story, the boy starts off as a young child; he enjoyed climbing up the trunk of the tree, swing from the branches and sleep in the shade as the boy grew, the tree grew as well. The tree, only wanted the boy to be happy so she sacrificed her apples, branches, and eventually her trunk and stump (Silverstein.) Although this story does not talk about emotional or mental growth, it shows physical growth (Silverstein.) The boy is shown as a young boy in the beginning through the pictures and as the story continues on he gets older, taller and more mature looking (Silverstein.) The boy’s needs are met by using every single part of the tree; this helped the boy to grow throughout life. 
						</p>
						<p>My parents have raised me since I was born. They have given me everything I could possibly need and more. Like the giving tree and my parents they are there and have been watching me since I was a child. They have been giving me food, like the tree and her apples (Silverstein.) They have given me a home, like the tree when she gave her branches to the boy in order for him to make a house (Silverstein.) My parents have also given me ways to get around whether by car or by bicycle. The tree did the same as well; she gave him her trunk (Silverstein.) My parents have also given me a place to rest and to support me when I need them the most. The giving tree did the same to the boy; she gave him her stump (Silverstein.) The last thing left of her. My parents can do what the tree could do, which is to support me and watch me grow as they give the most important things in life to me.
						</p>
						<p>       The first colony in America was in Jamestown, Virginia in 1620 (“Colonial America.”) Many of the pilgrims came here to start a new life, which could be achieved back in 1620 (“Colonial America.”) The king offered land and money to settlers (“Colonial Economy.”) He was able to provide them what they needed. The king was looking out for his own benefit though, he sent people there so his country would be able to prosper (“Colonial Economy.”) There were eventually thirteen colonies made in the United States and there was lots of growth compared to Jamestown in 1620 (“Colonial America.”)  America was prospering; they were able to create many raw goods to be shipped to Great Britain (“Colonial Economy.”) This was great for Britain for a while until the American settlers revolted against the king of Britain (“Colonial Economy.”) This historical American example shows that if needs are given to people then there will be growth. In this case, it was the spread of people, land, and money that is the growth.
						</p>
						<p>The Giving Tree written by Shel Silverstein, my parental support and Great Britain’s influence in the 1620s to America show that growth occurs when necessities are met.  America grew after needs were met by Great Britain back in 1620. I am able to grow because of my parents giving me what I need to grow. The boy was able to mature as the tree gave him what he needed in order to grow.</p>

							<h2>Gotta Make a Change</h2>
						</a>
						<p class="date">Published: November 1, 2016</p>
						<p>The song, “Man in the Mirror” by Michael Jackson, thinks about changing life because it could benefit the life later on.  “Man in the Mirror” by Michael Jackson shows that making a change may help in the future (“Man.”)   Before I got a job, my life felt dull and pointless but once I got a job life became meaningful. The American dream is experienced by many immigrants that want to change their living conditions from their home country to America. Through this song, “Man in the Mirror” by Michael Jackson, my life before getting a job and the American dream, growth occurs after a change in environment or way to approach an obstacle.</p>
						<p> In the song, “Man in the Mirror” by Michael Jackson, Jackson mostly talks about the difference one person can make (“Man.”)  Through the line, “I'm starting with the man in the mirror. I'm asking him to change his ways” and “If you want to make the world a better place. Take a look at yourself and then make that Change!” Jackson is saying that the person that looks at himself or herself at a mirror can make a difference (“Man.”) If it is just one person that is changing, it can create a domino effect and cause others to change. Jackson is telling people through song that it takes one person to get more involved and make a difference (“Man.”)  If a person is able to get involved and engage others into a cause they all believe in, a growth in society will occur.</p>
						<p>  I was a boring person before I changed the way I lived after getting my first paid job. My life was school, music, school, and sleep. It was a cycle. I would do the same thing every day and I did not change anything about it. When I was told by mother to find a job, I had to agree. It was close to the summer and I needed to find something to do in the afternoons besides play computer all day. When I was able to find a job, my life turned around. I became more sociable and I had a place in society. After being placed in a new environment, I grew socially. It is easier to make conversation and talk. I did not have a cycle that made me stay the same. </p>
						<p>   Immigrants sometimes think, “America is a place full of opportunities. It’s safer there and I won’t get in trouble for something I say against the government,” so they move to the United States having the American dream (“American.”) There are many interpretations of the American Dream; one interpretation of it is coming to America to in order to obtain a better life compared to the country a person currently resides (“American.”) Growth occurs within a family when a family moves from one country to another. My family is a prime example. My grandmother and grandfather brought along their kids to America, they endured the harsh conditions they were put through on the way to get to where I am now. They used to live in Vietnam and they wanted to leave to avoid the corruption going on after the Vietnam War in 1975. My family and other families were shoved into a boat and had to live in different camps until they arrived to America. Originally, my grandparents had a mindset of saving money and hoping that their children would eventually do well and help support them when they grew old. My dad was able to experience the hardships that went along from the boat rides to the camps to finally getting to America. His view on life changed. Once my dad was able to get a family, he was able to retell his experiences and put them onto me. The change in environment made him grow and adapt because he now knows English compared to before when living in Vietnam, camps and the early years of arriving to the United States.</p>
						<p>  The song, “Man in the Mirror” sung by Michael Jackson, the American dream and the change in my life after getting a job shows that growth occurs when people change something about they do not like. Through the song, “Man in the Mirror” by Michael Jackson, he tells people to make a change even if you are alone because that is where it starts. Immigrants with the American dream move to America because they think that if they move to a different country life will be better there instead of where they originally lived. I was able to break the dull cycle to include working, which was a new environment that I did not touch before. </p>

							<h2>Battles Between Cyrus, America and Myself</h2>
						</a>
						<p class="date">Published: October 18, 2016</p>
						<p>The song, “The Climb,” sung by Miley Cyrus, tells that there are many paths and there will be obstacles along the way, but when a person gets over those obstacles they will be able to achieve their goal. Through this song, it shows that growth occurs when people try to get over the obstacles in the pathways. America wanted to be independent, so they fought against the king. “The Climb,” sung by Miley Cyrus tells the personal struggles that Cyrus had to face in the music industry. My independent battle to break out of the bubble I made for myself when I was a freshman in high school. In the popular song, “The Climb,” sung by Miley Cyrus, America’s past with the European king and through my self-battle, it shows that there are many complications that can get in the way of what needs to be seen in order to grow.
						</p>
						<p>When Miley Cyrus first started in the music industry, she always had the eyes of the public watching her. She was always considered a role model for small children. Now the articles about her online discuss Cyrus’ “acting out.” Through her song, it seems like she needed to break out of her shell she was in, created by Disney. The lyrics in the song, “The Climb,” “I can almost see it. That dream I'm dreaming, but there's a voice inside my head saying you'll never reach it,” to me it feels like Cyrus has a dream but she had a feeling that she would not be able to break out of it because of the kid-friendly image Disney created for her (Cyrus.) Then in another line in her song she says, “Always gonna be an uphill battle sometimes I'm gonna have to lose,” she is saying to me that it will be hard because of all the obstacles in the way of being a rising star but she is okay with having to lose some fans that followed her from the beginning (Cyrus.) Then the next line, “Ain't about how fast I get there ain't about what's waitin' on the other side it's the climb,” this part made me think about the time she released this song; she released it in 2009 when she was with Disney (Cyrus.) Since that time, she has been getting more and racier with her content because of her break away from Disney: wearing less and doing adult acts. As of 2013, some people could say, “She’s grown up, she has seen the other side,” and it is true; she has gained worldwide fame, made top singles on the charts and has become something completely different from when she first started. From 2005 when first joining Disney and breaking the obstacles of hate from former fans to now being twenty one and popular worldwide, she was able to become herself as she has said in an interview with Cosmopolitan (Lynch.)
						</p>
						<p> America was known for fighting against the “man” in the early history of the United States. Between the years, 1775 to 1783, the United States fought for independence from Great Britain (“Chronicle.”) The citizens thirteen colonies first thought the King of Great Britain was being too oppressive because of the high taxes that were placed on them (Morris.) There were many acts created by the Parliament in Great Britain to allow their country to earn money (Morris.) With every act created by Parliament, led to angry citizens in America (Morris.) Some of the acts made by Parliament was the Sugar, Currency, and the Stamp Act (Morris.) All of the acts had some kind of tax towards the American people that to lead to Great Britain to earn money (Morris.) Soon enough the citizens of the Thirteen Colonies were tired of Great Britain’s control of their land (Morris.) They were unhappy of the amount of control that Great Britain had so they revolted by throwing imported tea into the ocean (Morris.) After the Boston Tea Party, the citizens thought it would be beneficial for them to boycott the imported goods from Britain (Morris.) They had in mind that Great Britain would be sending their troops to America so they began to prepare for battle. Britain tried to force the colonists to cooperate; the thirteen colonies were prepared to battle with them so then it created the Revolutionary War (Morris.) Through eight years and a half, they were able to gain independence from Great Britain.  America wanted to be free from European control, but they had many different barriers in their way. Once America were able to become their own country, they were able to further grow by creating their own laws instead of Parliament placing laws on to them. The United States has the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution now. America has grown from being the “little kid” of Great Britain, to the “adult” that is able to make their own decisions.
						</p>
						<p>   I call my shyness a bubble, it is possible to break it but it is too pretty to break it. When I was a freshman in high school, I thought it would be good to lay low and try to get through high school. I had the image of high school being easy if I were to always be quiet, hence the “too pretty to break it.” Unfortunately, as my freshman year continued, my grades became worse and worse. I did not understand anything going on in science and I was doing poorly in math. So I did what I could and broke out my bubble for a little while to talk to my counselor and drop the math class I was taking and to take an easier math class. The change went my way and I was able to succeed through the year with a good grade in math. On the other hand, science did not go my way and I ended up with a bad grade. Through the entire year, I never really asked questions and looking back on it. I regret it. Before sophomore year, I got a job working in Kumon. I learned from the experience of getting my first job that I was able to do anything if I stopped being so shy. It proved to be true, I was able to get through sophomore year easily, including the science course I took. I broke out of my bubble and asked a lot of questions. My shyness is still a part of me, I still have an internal battle of whether I should really make a move or just be quiet about it. This year, I have realized that I have grown since when I started high school. It is my third year, I still have time to work on breaking out of bubble completely.</p>
						<p>      The song, “The Climb,” sung by Miley Cyrus, the American Revolution and my internal battle shows that growth occurs when fences are broken. Miley Cyrus was able to become a world famous superstar from being Disney’s puppet image of kid-friendly and a good role model. America was able to get away from Great Britain’s control over the colonies. I was able to realize my strengths if I stopped being shy. There is a growth when actions are made and obstacles are overcome.</p>

							<h2>A Fractured Ankle, Fire and the Law</h2>
						</a>
						<p class="date">Published: October 4, 2016</p>
						<p>The documentary, Linsanity, shows how Jeremey Lin rose to success in 2012. Jeremy Lin, an Asian-American basketball player said in his movie, Linsanity, “I'm going to make mistakes, I just have to be able to learn from them as quickly as possible. To learn faster, I watch film of myself and other good point guards, and then breaking down my mistakes and really analyzing them and seeing where I could have made better decisions,” through this quote he acknowledges that people make errors and it is best to use those blunders that he or other people made as a learning experience to improve and grow. Through the Civil Rights Movement, Lin’s statement and my life, growth occurs after faults are acknowledged.
						</p>
						<p> Everyone makes mistakes in their lifetime. Lin would often play a game of basketball the night before a state championship when he was in high school, but when he played at the YMCA instead of the school gym, he fractured his ankle (Linsanity.) He admitted, “It was my fault for being there in the first place,” this quote shows that he knows what he did wrong. The consequence for his error ended him on the bench for the season (Linsanity.) When his injury healed, he went back on the court, to discover new ways to get his team back to the state championship (Linsanity.) With the growth that he made after his injury, he managed to help his team win the state championship (Linsanity.) Through this life experience and his quote stated in the paragraph above, Lin accepts that errors are a way for a person to develop and become more mature.
						</p>
						<p>I may not be able to watch my own life through a camera lens but I am able to watch my own actions. My choices may not be great but if I recognize them quickly. I can make them easily changeable. When I was a kid, my parents would often tell me not to play with fire, not to be so close to the fireplace and not to put fingers into sockets. I was moderately mischievous when I was younger and there was a time that I got a hold of a lighter. One day, I lit a piece of paper on fire with the lighter and I watched as the colours illuminate in my hands. When I realized that it was hot, I quickly threw it into the trashcan. The contents in the trashcan lit on fire, resulting to a large flame coming out of the opening. By then I had realized my mistake and ran to my father to tell him what was wrong. He stopped the fire and no one got hurt. I learned from that experience that I should be careful with fire.
						</p>
						<p>Lin’s quote is reflective to American culture because of the past misjudgments made by America’s leaders that caused this society to grow. History class was important because it uses the past faults and teaches it for the future citizens. America would not have laws that stopped segregation if Americans did not recognize the cruel actions they had done towards different groups of people. Society before the Civil Rights Movement is different from today, words that were considered “okay to say” back in the 1950s are frowned upon when they are used in the present (Janken.) America has changed in our way of thinking, people have grown from the slip-ups of the past and individuals stride to make a change. Although American culture has not completely eliminated racism, there has been many modifications to this society using the examples from the past to move our society forward; such as the laws preventing segregation.
						</p>
						<p>Faults can be changed if they are acknowledged and a plan is developed to prevent it to repeat again; plans that could be unconscious or conscious. There is a growth when errors made in the past never occur again. In examples before the Civil Rights Movement, Lin’s statement and an experience in my life, most people experience growth after a mistake.

							<h2>Starting at the Bottom & Continually Digging</h2>
						</a>
						<p class="date">Published: September 20, 2016</p>
						<p>Bo Burnham’s book, “Egghead”, has a collection of poems, some that are literal in meaning, and others that are just for comedic purposes. In the particular poem, “Rock Bottom,” Bo Burnham, talks about a man trying to dig through a hole because he cannot go up. Bo Burnham’s life reflects on the poem, “Rock Bottom,” in the way that he was at rock bottom when he first started putting himself out on the internet. America’s experience with the Cold War showed that they were already at rock bottom when the war already started because of previous war, World War II; this war showed that because America kept on bringing more and more weapons out in order to try to win. My experience shows that growth in friendship occurs when a friend that lost my trust is able to overcome it by continuously trying to get back my trust in them. The poem, “Rock Bottom,” written by Bo Burnham, America’s experience with the Cold War and my experience with trust from others, shows that growth occurs once people have hit rock bottom there is a way to get back up if they keep up their actions. 
						</p>
						<p>Bo Burnham started off his career as a seventeen year old on his bed making videos for YouTube because of his start his career launched into many different directions; he is now a comedian, actor, musician and author (“Zinoman.”) He started at rock bottom as an internet celebrity and was able to keep going with his fame and fortune (“Bo.”) From his poem, “Rock Bottom,” there is a line that says “I certainly can’t head upward, so I’ll try digging through”, this line shows that he cannot go back on what he has already done (Burnham 7-16.). The poem and Burnham’s life relates to growth, he had to start off at the bottom as an internet celebrity and because he was an already an internet celebrity it caused him continue his life through many different entertainment jobs (“Bo.”)
						</p>
						<p>America was already at rock bottom after World War II, even if the side that America was on won; America theoretically won because the other country was not able to support the growing military advancements (“Cold.”) Everyone that fought was exhausted from the previous war (“Cold.”) When the Cold War started there was a lot of stress. The stress was coming from the opposing side from the United States. The United States was afraid of who would make the first attack. There was no actual shots fired during this war but the United States was placing pressure on the Soviet Union (“Cold.”) Each side was trying to expand their military (“US.”) One side would build bomb shelters, then the other would follow (“US.”) It would continuously drain each country’s economy until the Soviet Union was not able to follow the United States in their military advancements (“End.”)
						</p>
						<p>In friendships, the first thing I think of is trust and the connection one person shares with the other. I have had a moment in my life where the people in my friend group did not trust each other. There was the spreading of hurtful rumours. At that moment in my life, I was potentially in rock bottom even though I was not participating in the rumours but being friends with two different people that disliked each other. Both friends told me not to trust the other. It was hard moment because I was not able to do anything about it except for listen to them. The plan backfired for me because I was reeled into the rumour mill and there was not any trust between my friend group. I was not able to do anything about it, but to just be associated with the group. I kept on trying to make more friends, which I did, and they are still my friends because there is an open discussion. We are able to speak to each other openly on what each person believes and trust each other. I grew from being with friends with trust issues to friends that I could are my true friends. I was able to break away from the mistrust from the “rock bottom” but I still keep on digging because it is just a block on the road, there is more of the road to experience.
						</p>
						<p>Through Bo Burnham’s poem, “Rock Bottom,” American’s fight during the Cold War and my friendship experience, growth occurs after a person hits rock bottom and finds a way to get past it. Rock bottom is just a block on the road stopping people from passing. If people chip at it enough somehow they will break the rock and continue on. The person may even learn a better way to get past the block. I was able to find true friends that I can trust and grow from the experiences of the bad friend by using those mistakes to avoid possible mishaps in friendships. Burnham was able to make a breakthrough in the entertainment industry after putting himself out into the internet and ultimately gaining internet fame. America was able to break the “rock” by expanding their military as much as they could to make the Soviet Union to withdraw from the war.

							<h2>This I Believe || Maybe An Improved Me</h2>
						</a>
						<p class="date">Published: September 6, 2016</p>
						<p>I used to believe that I would be successful in high school if I just stayed quiet and kept my thoughts to myself. In my first year of high school, I did not have very many people around me that I saw as friends. All my friends that I had before changed or we were never in contact. I was a master at blending into crowds, being quiet and unseen. It all had changed when I was encouraged to get a job for the summer. 
						</p>
						<p>I called every single place I knew, asking if they were hiring teenagers. I found a place that was hiring teenagers and sent in my resume. A week later, I got an email to come into the office and take a placement test. I did not pass nor did I fail. A couple days later, I was called in again for an interview. I remember being confident and happy at that moment. I was grateful someone gave me a chance. I got the job. I worked that summer and by the time school was about to start up again I thought to myself. I will become bold and make friends.
						</p>
						<p>When school started up again, I reverted back to my old self. Quiet and antisocial. This went on until half way through the year, when I passed the test and did well in orchestra. It was another confidence boost, I was first chair in concert orchestra. The first thing that came into my mind was that I made a difference. It felt incredible. When my seat in orchestra was taken away, I went back to my old self, quiet, but not antisocial.
						</p>
						<p>This year, I promised to myself, I will be outgoing, bold and do well in school. So far, I have been doing all that and I am continuing to do that because I like the feeling. It isn’t hard to make friends or get to know anyone. All I had to do is greet the person and introduce myself. 
						</p>
						<p>Looking back at what I have already done this year compared to other years, I would say that I have really changed or, a better word, grew.
